## ‚öôÔ∏è Fortran Code Overview

These algorithms analyze the structure of mobility networks and generate dendrograms for community identification.  
**Input**: Weighted network matrix (mobility data from IBGE, with weights of the input network corresponding to the number of persons moving from one IGR to another), node count, and threshold parameters.  
**Output**: Unweighted network representations used in subsequent algorithms.

### üìÇ Fortran Algorithms

1. **Convert weighted mobility network into unweighted counterpart**  
   `redecrit1mc13.for`  
   Uses dissimilarity to determine critical mobility weights for Sentinel Index evaluation.  
   *Input file*: `ms_BA_rodo_34rgi_fs.dat`

2. **Generate adjacency matrix**  
   `simi.f90`  
   Produces adjacency matrix for selected critical mobility weight.

3. **Generate neighborhood matrix**  
   `madchar13.for`  
   Uses adjacency matrix to generate corresponding neighborhood matrix.

4. **Community detection and dendrogram construction**  
   `dendo2uQ.for`  
   Implements Newman-Girvan method to identify community structure.

5. **Compute betweenness centrality**  
   `betweenness.f90`  
   Uses Brandes algorithm to evaluate node importance via shortest paths.

## üêç Python Code Overview

These notebooks evaluate infection transmission and surveillance indices using mobility and healthcare data. The first algorithm is used to evaluate the potential number of infection transmission between IRG‚Äôs based on the metapopulation model. Input data consists of two tables, one containing the numbers of URTI-related PHC encounters in each IGR, and the other one containing the number of persons moving from one IGR to another, extracted from the IBGE mobility data. 

The second algorithm evaluates the Sentinel Index. Input data consists of three lists, containing the IGR population, the total number of infections exported by each IGR, and the betweeness centrality score of the network nodes evaluated at the selected value of the weight threshold (as identified using the code above).

### üìò Notebooks

- **Meta-Population SIR Model**  
  `SIRmeta_RGI.ipynb`  
  Simulates disease spread across IGRs using mobility and PHC data, based on the metapopulation model.

- **Sentinel Surveillance Index Evaluation**  
  `Sentinel_index.ipynb`  
  Assesses surveillance indices to identify critical regions for monitoring.

**Inputs**:
- URTI-related PHC encounters per IGR
- Mobility data between IGRs (from IBGE)
- IGR population
- Exported infections per IGR
- Betweenness centrality scores
