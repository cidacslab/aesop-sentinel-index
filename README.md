Network Science and Sentinel Surveillance
This repository contains codes and materials related to sentinel surveillance analysis.

Repository Contents
• LICENSE: File containing the license to use the repository.
• Network science algorithms.zip: Package containing algorithms for network analysis
• SIRmeta_RGI.ipynb: Notebook for SIR modeling and spatial epidemiological dynamics in Immediate Geographic Regions (RGIs).
• Sentinel_index.ipynb: Notebook for calculating sentinel surveillance indices.

Models Implemented in Python
1. Meta-population SIR Model (SIRmeta_RGI.ipynb)
This notebook implements a SIR model to study the spread of diseases in different Immediate Geographic Regions (RGIs), taking into account urban mobility data and primary health care data.

2. Sentinel Surveillance Index (Sentinel_index.ipynb)
This notebook calculates surveillance indices to identify critical regions for disease monitoring.

Requirements
To run the notebooks, make sure you have installed:
• Python 3.8+
• Jupyter Notebook
• Libraries: numpy, pandas, networkx, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn

Algorithms Implemented in Fortran
These algorithms are used to study the structure of the network, leading to the construction of a dendrogram for community identification.

Requirements
To run the algorithms, make sure you have installed a Fortran compiler
• Gfortran
• Intel Fortran Compiler
